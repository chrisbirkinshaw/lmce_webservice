Small add on web app for the Linux MCE system which provides a basic web interface for the more technically-minded, and a RESTful API.


INSTALL

At the moment this is just for testing, so cd to /var/www on you LMCE Server, then run

git clone git://github.com/chrisbirkinshaw/lmce_webservice.git 

and start the test server with

cd lmce_webservice
script/server -b 192.168.80.1 (internal network address)
 

USAGE

Start with:

http://192.168.80.1:3000/installations

You should be then able to browse from there. 

Changing /installations/1 to installations/1.xml gives you XML output, suitable for consuming by another application.
